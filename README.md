# Training-a-linear-regression-model
Using a regularized linear regression model to predict amount of water flowing out of damn using change of water level. 
Done with the help of Stanford's online Machine Learning course. 
In this project we trained a regularized linear regression model, tested it on a cross-validation dataset, and chose
the best fit parameters using a learning curve and optimaztion algorithms.
